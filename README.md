Integrative Project â€“ 20 concepts used

User stories - In this project we used user stories to help us create our application.  A user story is small, consistent & succinct form of describing a piece of
functionality that application should provide

Scrum master - A scrum master has added these user stories for us to complete.  Scrum master add stories for team members to complete and they protect the scrum process and prevent distractions.

Scrum meeting - A scrum meeting is where our user stories were given to us.  In scrum meetings product owners and developers meet regularly to collaborate and remove obstacles.

Sprint - This is the last sprint before the MVP launch.  A sprint is an iteration that typically last 2 weeks.  Software components are incrementally build sprint after sprint.

MVP - This is the last sprint before the MVP launch.  A MVP is the minimum viable product.  This is the core application features that all the application to be usable.

Product Owner -  The Product Owner reminded the team of the following critical metrics.  A product owner determines what needs to be done and sets the priorities to deliver the highest value.

HTTP request - For our project, when we view our pages in a browser requests are sent for the pages using the HTTP protocol, and they are triggered when user clicks on button or link in the navigation.

DNS - For our project we were asked to modify a hosts file.  We added a IP for the address www.slacker.com.  When we go to any page on the web, the address is resolved into an IP, just as we did in the hosts file.  The servers that resolve the IP are called Domain Name Servers

HTML5 - We used HTML5 for our project.  HTML is Hyperlink Text Markup Language and defines structure of web content.
 
CSS - We used CSS for styling our project.  CSS is Cascading Style Sheets and they define the look and feel of the content.

Javascript - We used javascript for the channels page to make the messaging interactive.  Javascript is a web programming language that adds interactivity to web content.

MVC - The MVC is the Model View Controller design pattern.  We used MVC in our project.  The Model was the messages database on the server, the view was our HTML markup in the browser and the controller was our javascript.

Object Oriented Programming - The messages in our project are examples of objects.  Objects consist of information that can be manipulated.

Client/Server model -  In this project the server is the www.slacker.com server that is holding our html, css and javascript documents.  The clients is the computer we use to navigate to our pages in our browser.

Front End vs Back End -  The front end of our project is the HTML and CSS styling on those pages that are viewed in the browser.  The back end of our project is when we used vagrant to upload our project to the hosting server.  The back end is also the messaging server that handles our messages.

jQuery - jQuery is an example of a javascript library that makes coding javascript easier.  jQuery was used in the javascript for our messages.js
  
Agile - For the project we used the Agile methodology when getting our user stories from the scrum master and having the scrum meeting.  Agile emphasize simple, iterative application development.  The addition of user stories in a sprint is an example of this.

Responsive design - our project is meant to be responsive.  Being responsive means that our web content adjusts to the different viewports of devices.  We made our project responsive by using relative numbers in the css.

git - git is a example of version control.  We used git and GitHub to upload our project on to the server.  

Text Editor & IDE - for this project I used the IDE Visual Studio code.  An IDE is a Integrated Development Environment.  IDE's make coding easier because they integrate tools and debuging software.  For this project, the colour coding that Visual Studio Code helped me debug my code.
